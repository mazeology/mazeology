- 👋 Hello! I’m @mazeology, an imaginative, down to earth, and curious software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, learning principles/theory, and creating awesome user experiences. The ability for humans to learn and adapt is awesome!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/expanding knowledge in K8s, Go, Unity 3D, and working on silly projects here https://github.com/mazeology/impractical-projects 😊.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code for a good cause.
- 📫 Reach me via linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-maze/
